# Dream Sharing Platform

Dream Sharing Platform is a frontend-focused web application where users can share their dreams and aspirations through written posts. The platform is designed to encourage people to inspire and support each other by interacting with shared dreams.

This project was **developed individually** as a personal project.

## Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to create a social space where users can:
- Share their dreams in text form
- Create a profile with a profile picture
- Follow other users
- Discover new dreams through an exploration system
- Support and motivate others by reading and engaging with their ideas

The platform is planned to be expanded with additional features in future development phases.

## Technical Scope
- The project currently focuses on **frontend development**
- User interactions such as posting, following, and discovery are designed from a UI/UX perspective
- Backend functionality is minimal and planned for future implementation

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## AI Assistance
During the development process, AI-based tools were used as a support resource for learning, problem-solving, debugging, and code optimization. All design decisions, implementation, and final structure were created and controlled by the developer.
